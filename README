I decided to try use the Django web framework to run rabuissa.o using the python subprocess module. As such, there are some files such as manage.py and settings.py that were generated by the initialization of the Django project--I did not write these, but I modified them to do what I needed the server to do.

Unfortunately, I was unable to get the .o file to run on the EC2 instance, so I just ended up using Django to serve up some gnarly css.

UPDATE: I figured out that recompiling the .c file is necessary to deal with the different EC2 architecture, so I added that to my hook and everything works.

The only link necessary is http://ec2-54-244-158-160.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ which is my ec2. Everything else is linked from there.

Email me at razzi53 (gmail) if anything goes wrong.
