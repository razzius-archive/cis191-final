I decided to use the Django web framework to run rabuissa.o using the python subprocess module. As such, there are some files such as manage.py and settings.py that were generated by the initialization of the Django project--I did not write these, but I modified them to do what I needed the server to do.

The only link necessary is http://ec2-54-244-158-160.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ which is my ec2. Everything else is linked from there.

Email me at razzi53 (gmail) if anything goes wrong.
